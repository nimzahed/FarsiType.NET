# About
I wanted to use RTL text in [ImGui.NET](https://github.com/ImGuiNET/ImGui.NET) (.NET wrapper for [dear imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)) and tried several approaches, but none were satisfactory. Then, I discovered a C++ project called [FarsiType](https://github.com/AmyrAhmady/FarsiType/), which inspired me to create a similar solution for .NET in C#.
## compatibility
- .net-standard2.1
- .net8.0, 9.0, above
- Native Aot Compatible ( So every language that support C/CPP )
